# Self Evaluation

- __How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?__
I feel confident that I understand the each method.
- __This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?__
As the small group saw firsthand I did struggle at first with the whole composition/syntax of the whole iteration. After working through the practice on my own I fell much more confident and felt like I had a better understanding while completing the CFU challenges.
- __What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?__
I still need to practice the whole process more to really solidify the concept.
- __What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?__
I don't have any questions at the moment, but I will reach out to my group if I do.
